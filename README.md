# DemoPolarSphericalTransformGeometry

This is a simple C++ project attemting to create grid like materials and setup. The geometrical patterns are inspired by the transforms geometry that I use in my research. This contains the c++ code to simulate the diagrams in my paper and showcase the powerful use of the UE4 tool for research purposes.
